### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance software engineer and entrepreneur from Finland. I have a passion for programming, servers, networking and anything in between.

Notable projects include [Kidday](https://kidday.com) and [nanocurrency-web](https://github.com/numsu/nanocurrency-web-js). Kidday is a mobile application targeted towards families. It allows users to build a closed community around their families and share photos and videos of their children to loved ones in a social media style setting. Nanocurrency-web is a cryptography library that offers several high-level easy-to-use interfaces for developers helping them develop applications on top of the [Nano](https://nano.org) cryptocurrency.
