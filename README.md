### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance developer from Finland. I have a passion for programming, servers, networking and anything in between. Most of my projects are related to the Nano cryptocurrency. I've developed [nanocurrency-web](https://github.com/numsu/nanocurrency-web-js) in order to help developers embrace Nano and to provide a secure way to handle the users' keys.

Notable side projects include [Kidday](https://kidday.com). Kidday is a mobile application targeted towards families. It allows users to build a closed community around their families and share photos and videos of their children to loved ones in a social media style setting.
